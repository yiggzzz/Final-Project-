# Phishing Detection Website

## Purpose 
- To identify if there is a threat of phishing based on whether a URL is seeking to steal data, money, or both. 

## Project Overview
- A phishing website is a common social engineering method that mimics
trustful uniform resource locators (URLs) and webpages. Phishing is a form
of fraud where an attacker disguises a website as a reputable entity 
in email or other forms of communications. The objective of this project is 
to train machine learning models and deep neural networks on the dataset created
to predict phishing websites. Both phishing and benign URLs of websites 
are gathered to form a dataset and from the required URL
and website content-based features are extracted. The performance level
of each model is measures and compared.

## Approach to create website
- Write code to extract the required features from csv file
- Analyze and preprocess the dataset by using EDA techniques
- Divide the dataset into training and testing sets
- Run selected machine learning and deep neural network algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, Autoencoder on the dataset
- Write a code for displaying the evaluation result considering accuracy metrics
- Compare the obtained results for trained models and specify which is better

## Outcomes 
- The website will be able to determine whether or not a URL is phishing or legitimate. 

## Software/Tools
- Google Colab, Python, Deep Learning and Neural Networks
