#  Phishing Detection 

##  Description of the source of our dataset
  - Topic was taken from [10 Best Machine Learning Projects with datasets](https://medium.com/@letthedataconfess/10-best-machine-learning-projects-with-datasets-6184839c9100), which was posted by Jamie Miller on the Ask-the-Class slack channel. From this link, we clicked the dataset [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/web-page-phishing-detection-dataset) for the 5th best project, Phishing Detection.
  
## Reason why we selected topic
 - Being that it is on the top 10 Best Machine Learning, we wanted use the dataset that would be ideal, especially for Machine Learning. 

## Questions we hope to answer 
- Will we be able to determine whether or not a URL is phishing or legitimate?
- Which machine learning model will be better for our dataset?
- After cleaning and pre-processing our data, is our dataset optimized enough to go through different machine learning models?

## Purpose 
- To identify if there is a threat of phishing based on whether a URL is seeking to steal data, money, or both. 

## Project Overview
- A phishing website is a common social engineering method that mimics
trustful uniform resource locators (URLs) and webpages. Phishing is a form
of fraud where an attacker disguises a website as a reputable entity 
in email or other forms of communications. The objective of this project is 
to train machine learning models and deep neural networks on the dataset created
to predict phishing websites. Both phishing and benign URLs of websites 
are gathered to form a dataset and from the required URL
and website content-based features are extracted. The performance level
of each model is measures and compared.

## Approach to create website
- Write code to extract the required features from csv file
- Analyze and preprocess the dataset by using EDA techniques
- Run selected machine learning and deep neural network algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, Autoencoder on the dataset
- Write a code for displaying the evaluation result considering accuracy metrics
- Compare the obtained results for trained models and specify which is better

## Outcomes 
- Our model will be able to predict whether or not a given URL is phishing or legitimate. 


## Software/Tools
- Jupyter Lab, Python, Tableau, SQLalchemy, and Google Slides
